best movie

Write a few paragraphs in an html file that describe the best movie that you have seen lately. Be sure to use doctype, html, head, body, header, h1, footer and main semantic markup. In the footer, put a link to whatever it was that you saw. Also put your paragraphs in `<p></p>` tags.

Use css to apply 3 different foreground and background color combinations to the text that you have written. 1 color for `<h2...>` tags in the main element. 1 color for `<p>` tags in the main element and 1 color for the header and footer elements.

Make sure that your html code validates at [http://validator.w3.org/](http://validator.w3.org/). Make sure that your css code validates at [http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator). Submit a link to your github to the dropbox provided.
