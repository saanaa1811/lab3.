    <h2>Euphoria</h2>
</header>
<main>My best movie would be Euphoria, its quite relatable to this generation. 
    Its about high school students who face consequences to their own mistakes, struggles with dealing with relationships be it family, friendships and also issues like mental health addiction etc. 
    The main character Rue is a young teenager who has a lot of problem in quitting drugs. 
    This movie teaches a lot how to calmly deal with any situation in life and not make quick decisions </main>
